      Sim racing / racing esports industry has come a long way in the last few
      years:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside ml-6">
      <li class="pb-4">
        Racing sims are becoming incredibly good at simulating reality (likely
        closest esports to reality)
      </li>
      <li class="pb-4">
        Best competitors are now part of professional esports teams, and
        real-life pros are participating too
      </li>
      <li class="pb-4">
        Event organizers are getting exceptionally good at creating interesting
        competitions and broadcasting them
      </li>
      <li class="pb-4">
        Sim racing arguably provides better “relatable” interactive
        entertainment vs traditional motorsports
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">
      At its core, sim racing is about competing for the best track performance.
      In that sense, sim racing has replicated real-life motorsports, with
      telemetry data playing an increasing important role in the field. In our
      opinion, there is significant room for innovation in this space,
      especially given the latest developments in big data technology and AI /
      ML fields.

    <p class="mb-4">
      We’ve created Fidgrove because we love sim racing and haven't found the
      solution we wanted for ourselves. We’re data geeks working hard to make
      our vision happen. Something with personalized superpowers. Something
      seamless. Something efficient. Something beautiful. That’s quite a tall
      order and no wonder no one has crafted it yet.
